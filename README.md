# TShirtSizeConverter
Just some fun with recursion

also use of SpecFlow for BDD

plus an example of floating point (double) equality comparison with tolerance

## Subject Matter
The subject matter is less important that the learning points, however it could be useful for estimating user stories

One could use this in a spreadsheet

`=IF(ISNA(SWITCH($D2,"T Shirt XS",0.5,"T Shirt S",1,"T Shirt M",2,"T Shirt L",5,"T Shirt XL",13,"T Shirt XXL",34)),0,SWITCH($D2,"T Shirt XS",0.5,"T Shirt S",1,"T Shirt M",2,"T Shirt L",5,"T Shirt XL",13,"T Shirt XXL",34))`
